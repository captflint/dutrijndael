## Don't Use This

This repository contains my attempt to implement AES in
python. The purpose of this project is my own education and
interest. I am *not* an encryption expert. **Please do not
use this code to encrypt anything sensitive or for real
world applications.** There are other freely available
implementations of AES that are superior to my own in every
way.

That said, please feel free to use my code for educational
purposes, or to play around with, or just to sneer snidely
at how much better at coding you are than me.

## Status

This code does not work. This is a work in progress. Key
expansion is implemented and seems to work properly now. Mix
Columns seems to be working now.
